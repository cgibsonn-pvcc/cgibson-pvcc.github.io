<p>While the Internet has no doubt transfigured the face of commerce with novel—yet profoundly useful—innovations, it also has a dark side: cybercrime, criminal activity distributed through the Internet. Individuals and corporations have become so reliant upon computer applications for their financial lives that disruptions to these applications by criminals can produce devastating consequences. Using techniques such as hacking and phishing, cybercriminals can capitalize on this dependency to the detriment of both consumers and companies. Fortunately, defenses exist that can neuter these unlawful activities.</p>
<br>
<p>First, “hacking” describes the use of an unauthorized means of access to an electronic device, computer network or computer system (“What Is Hacking”). By breaking into other people’s devices, hackers can access critical financial information, including bank account numbers (“What Is Hacking”). They can then utilize this data to make illicit purchases. Furthermore, hackers can insert computer programs known as ransomware onto digital devices in order to deny access to vital applications until a ransom is paid (“What Is Hacking”). Deliberate and calculated, a well-placed hacking operation can bring even major corporations to their knees.</p>
<br>
<p>Second, “phishing” describes the extraction of sensitive information by impersonating a legitimate organization through a computer application; specifically, email, telephone, or text message (“What Is Phishing”). For example, phishers can send fraudulent links that appear as valid websites (“What Is Phishing”). As a case in point, if a phisher desired to access the login information of a student at PVCC (Piedmont Virginia Community College), he or she could send that student a fake login with “pucc” substituted in the web address in place of “pvcc.” Moreover, phishers can transmit ransomware through attachments on their online messages (“What Is Phishing”). Undoubtedly, phishing represents one of the greatest threats caused by widespread dependence on the Internet.</p>
<br>
<p>Despite the dangers posed by cybercrime methods such as hacking and phishing, effective countermeasures exist that safeguard online commerce. The use of sophisticated passwords can block hackers from stealing credentials (“What Is Hacking”). Additionally, financial institutions, such as banks, implement monitoring systems to insulate monetary data from phishers (“What Is Phishing”). On an individual level, consumers can protect themselves against phishers by adjusting their browser settings to autonomously obstruct deceptive websites from opening (“What Is Phishing”). Insidious yet defeatable, cybercrimes can be undermined using relatively straightforward precautions.</p>
<br>
<p>Concludingly, consumers and businesses can reap the benefits of the Internet on commerce while minimizing the vulnerabilities that come with those benefits. While the Internet has opened world markets to new forms of disruption from criminals—especially hacking and phishing—the upsides significantly outweigh the costs as long as proper security measures are taken.</p>
