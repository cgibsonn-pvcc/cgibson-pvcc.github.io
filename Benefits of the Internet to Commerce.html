<p>By enabling the advent of ecommerce—the digital transaction of goods and services—the Internet has yielded invaluable boons to businesses and consumers alike (Bloomenthal; Zande). Facilitating the rise of electronic retail, crowdfunding, and digital products, the Internet has opened new options for buyers while diminishing costs for sellers (Zande).</p>
<br>
<p>To begin, electronic retail provides the advantages of greater accessibility, increased product selection, and reduced start-up costs as compared with in-person retail (Bloomenthal; Zande). Because internet transactions don’t require physical interaction between buyers and sellers, digital commerce can occur at any time (Bloomenthal). Contrastingly, in-person sales can only happen while a physical place of business, such as a store, remains open. Furthermore, online shopping offers superior variety versus in-person shopping (Bloomenthal). This results from the fact that brick-and-mortar stores have limited exposition space while online stores do not. Additionally, electronic retail benefits sellers by reducing start-up costs (Bloomenthal; Zande). Unlike traditional retailers, online retailers can avoid the costs associated with physical stores (Zande). Without a doubt, the creation of electronic retail represents one of the most impactful effects of the internet on commerce.</p>

<p>Next, the Internet extends the reach of crowdfunding programs. “Crowdfunding” describes a method of raising capital for new business ventures through contributions by large numbers of people (Smith). Because of the expansive reach of websites and social media, crowdfunding using the Internet grows the pool of potential investors beyond the traditional sources of start-up funds (Smith). For context, these traditional sources encompass the owners of the fledgling business, the owners’ relatives, and venture capitalists (Smith). Regarding the efficacy of internet crowdfunding, the website GoFundMe embodies the largest crowdfunding platform (Smith). As of 2024, GoFundMe has raised more than $30 billion across 150 million donors and beneficiaries (Smith). Evident and palpable, the ascendance of computer applications has opened the door for mass crowdfunding that might not be possible otherwise.</p>
<br>
<p>Finally, the Internet has unlocked a new domain of commerce exclusive to it; namely, the market of digital goods. Existing entirely in digital form, digital goods have no physical subsistence (Zande). These virtual products include visual files, audio files, and e-books (Zande). Representing a textbook example of ecommerce, the market of digital goods involves items that are traded, transported, and consumed entirely online.</p>
<br>
<p>In conclusion, the Internet has revolutionized the global marketplace by giving rise to ecommerce—the digital exchange of goods and services. Demonstrated by the innovations of electronic retail, crowdfunding programs, and digital goods, the benefits of the Internet to commerce cannot be overstated.</p>
